## Our Mission

Our main focus on our project is prioritizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities, and 12, Responsible Consumption and Production. We are looking at the University of Washington and creating a platform to educate the community on recycling and waste management. Our platform will have some information to teach about the recycling requirements on the UW campus as well as a quiz to practice what you learn. The goal is to teach the community about the specific waste management starting on the UW campus and eventually spreading to other parts of Seattle or other college campuses.

## How Might We Statement
How might we encourage University of Washington students to engage in responsible consumption practices to reduce waste and promote sustainability within their campus community?
